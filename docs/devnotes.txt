Started with https://github.com/angular/universal-starter

on "npm install", two issues were addressed:
  1) many warnings about peerDependency mismatches

     in package.json, updated minimum version for @nguniversal/* to
     7.0.2.  Reran npm install, all fixed.

  2) detected 1 vulnerability with webpack-dev-server
     - a depenendency of @angular-devkit/build-angular, which is
       itself a devDependency.
     - 'npm audit' says need v3.1.11
     - couldn't figure out how to force it to get that version
     - @angular-devkit/build-angular required by start script
     - ignored issue, since it is a dev-time issue only

Confirmed sample app works both client-side only and under ssr.

In package.json, angular.json:  change ng-universal-demo to oar-lps

global styles:
  angular.json, under its "build" config, identfies style files to be
  loaded globally.  These are compiled into a minified version.

start up:
client-only:
  1. index runs main.ts:
     when HTML DOM content is loaded, the AppModule is bootstrapped.

  2. AppModule's bootstrap component is constructed and inserted into
     the DOM at <app-root> element.

server-side:
  1. server.ts runs:
     a. loads dist/server/main.js (compiled from main.server.ts?)
     b. bootstraps AppServerModule

  2. AppServerModule's bootstrap component is constructed and inserted into
     the DOM at <app-root> element.

Testing

from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46051134/does-karma-coexist-with-jasmine:

Karma: is a tool which spawns a web server that executes source code against
test code for each of the browsers connected. The results of each test against
each browser are examined and displayed via the command line to the developer.

Jasmine: is a development framework for testing js code. It does not depend on
any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a
clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.

CLI-provided versions for karma & jasmine featured detected vulnerabilities:
  updated to most recent version to get rid of them.

Had to update karma-jasmine-html-reporter to 1.4.0 to work with jasmine 3.1.0.
