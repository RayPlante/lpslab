Started with https://github.com/angular/universal-starter

on "npm install", two issues were addressed:
  1) many warnings about peerDependency mismatches

     in package.json, updated minimum version for @nguniversal/* to
     7.0.2.  Reran npm install, all fixed.

  2) detected 1 vulnerability with webpack-dev-server
     - a depenendency of @angular-devkit/build-angular, which is
       itself a devDependency.
     - 'npm audit' says need v3.1.11
     - couldn't figure out how to force it to get that version
     - @angular-devkit/build-angular required by start script
     - ignored issue, since it is a dev-time issue only

Confirmed sample app works both client-side only and under ssr.
